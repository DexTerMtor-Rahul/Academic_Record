## Running a Node.js Application

## Using npm

1. **Install dependencies:**

   - If your project has a `package.json` file, you can install the necessary dependencies by running:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   - If your project is configured to use a development server, you can start it by running:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

That's it! You've successfully installed and run a Node.js application, and learned how to use npm to manage dependencies and run a development server.
